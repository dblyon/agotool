; If you want to avoid that behaviour, add a --socket directive mapping to the required socket (the one that should be managed by the zerg server) and add the --zerg-fallback option.
; With this setup, if a Zerg server is not available, the Zerg client will continue binding normally to the specified socket(s).

;; uwsgitop interpretation
;WID -> worker id
;% -> percentage of served requests by the worker
;PID -> process id of the worker
;REQ -> number of managed requests
;RPS -> number of current requests handled per second
;EXC -> number of raised exceptions
;SIG -> number of managed uwsgi signals (NOT unix signals !!!)
;STATUS -> can be idle, busy, pause, cheaped or sig
;AVG -> average response time for the worker
;RSS -> RSS memory (need --memory-report)
;VSZ -> address space (need --memory-report)
;TX -> transmitted data
;RunT -> running time


;; FIFO Available commands
;‘0’ to ‘9’ - set the fifo slot (see below)
;‘+’ - increase the number of workers when in cheaper mode (add --cheaper-algo manual for full control)
;‘-‘ - decrease the number of workers when in cheaper mode (add --cheaper-algo manual for full control)
;‘B’ - ask Emperor for reinforcement (broodlord mode, requires uWSGI >= 2.0.7)
;‘C’ - set cheap mode
;‘c’ - trigger chain reload
;‘E’ - trigger an Emperor rescan
;‘f’ - re-fork the master (dangerous, but very powerful)
;‘l’ - reopen log file (need –log-master and –logto/–logto2)
;‘L’ - trigger log rotation (need –log-master and –logto/–logto2)
;‘p’ - pause/resume the instance
;‘P’ - update pidfiles (can be useful after master re-fork)
;‘Q’ - brutally shutdown the instance
;‘q’ - gracefully shutdown the instance
;‘R’ - send brutal reload
;‘r’ - send graceful reload
;‘S’ - block/unblock subscriptions
;‘s’ - print stats in the logs
;‘W’ - brutally reload workers
;‘w’ - gracefully reload workers
